video player using react for components and redux for player state

## basics
- video player
- search bar: powers video list
- video list: updates on-the-fly
- search utilizes YouTube API
- use redux to manage player state

    cd videomatic
    npm install
    npm start

webpack-dev-server will be running :: open browser to http://localhost:8080/


## inspiration
This project is intended to extend the video player created in [Stephen Grider's](https://github.com/StephenGrider) excellent course on Udemy, [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux). If you aren't able to view the course, I recommend his companion code at [ReduxCasts](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxCasts).
